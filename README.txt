When you download it from github, if you choose to run it in VS Code, make sure you open the subfolder named Distraction-Destroyer-main not the parent folder called Distraction-Destroyer-main

Also please do not close the shell that pops up when the app is run, closing this will terminate the program

We have tested that this program can shut down the following games/programs:
Minecraft, Fortnite, Valorant, League of Legends, Bluestacks Client, Steam launcher, Epic Games launcher, Riot games launcher. 
These are only the ones that we tested, however there are more that should work.
